From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

My goals are to deconstruct and rebuild the Google homepage with html and css

What I have learned..
  That there are many ways to do the same thing. Learning how elements of css change other elements of css. When I would fix one problem, it would seem another would appear.

What I could still fix..
  -make the search buttons link to the actual google search
  -the hover/active effects on the box surrounding the text box
